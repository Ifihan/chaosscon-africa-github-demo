# GitHub Copilot Session at CHAOSScon Africa

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot demo repository for CHAOSScon Africa! In this demo, we will showcase the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant developed by GitHub and OpenAI.

## About GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot leverages machine learning models to provide intelligent code suggestions and completions directly in your code editor. It learns from millions of lines of code from publicly available repositories to assist developers in writing code faster and more efficiently.

## Demo Repository Contents

This repository contains code examples and prompts that demonstrate the power of GitHub Copilot in Python and JavaScript. The examples showcase how Copilot can assist with tasks such as generating Fibonacci numbers in Python and checking for palindromes in JavaScript.

Feel free to explore the code examples, experiment with prompts, and see how Copilot can enhance your coding experience. Don't forget to review the suggestions and validate the generated code before integrating it into your projects.
